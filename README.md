# UniFriends

<p>University, for some of us it’s an amazing experience and for others its an experience that they would rather forget. In Victoria alone there are roughly 9 universities which together, have a total of approximately 350000 students. No matter if you’re starting out or if you’re already in your final year - making friends is an on going aspect of university. But what if you are shy? What if you genuinely struggle friends and struggle finding people with similar interests as you? </p>

<p>That is the basis of Unifriends. A platform built by students, for students. With Unifriends, our system will allow you to search for users that have similar interests as you and help you contact them directly. Whether you just want to find friends or form study groups - Unifriends will cater to any need. Unifriends - form life long relationships today. </p>
